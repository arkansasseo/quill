<h2>Making more money using Kindle Direct Publishing?</h2>
<p>Book sales is the most obvious way to make money from self publishing. You will either earn royalties (from self publishing platforms such as amazon's kindle direct publishing/kdp) or revenues (if you print, distribute and sell your book yourself). In terms of royalties, authors can earn as much as 35 percent for print books up to around 70 percent for ebooks (as of this writing), depending on the platform used. Those are decent returns for almost any business venture!.</p>
<h3>Has anyone ever used Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) to self-publish your work? W</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible to write a list like this without kindle direct publishing&mdash;which is widely respected as one of the foremost self-publishing platforms currently available. Working under the amazon family of products, there&rsquo;s nothing these guys can&rsquo;t help you with on your next self-publishing project. And, unlike other e-publishers, you can update your book online &mdash; even after it&rsquo;s been published.</p>
<p>If you self publish your print books as print on demand on kindle direct publishing (kdp), there is no way to offer a signed copy to your reader buyers. The only way you can offer signed copies for sale on amazon is by becoming an amazon seller through the fulfillment by amazon fba program. That has a host of costs and requirements that might not make it worth doing because of the limited number of signed copies you&rsquo;d actually sell.</p>
<p>Your craft book or ebook should not look self-published and should be as professionally and artfully presented as the projects you're featuring! for the best rendering of photos of techniques and completed projects at a reasonable cost for printed books, using a self-publishing platform with print on demand (pod) is recommended. You'll get commercial-level print quality without having to purchase boxes and boxes of books, as you would with standard commercial printing companies. With some platforms, such as amazon's kindle direct publishing (kdp, which encompasses the former createspace), you can purchase even just one book at a time. Plus, your readers can order from amazon direct without you ever having to personally ship a book!.</p>
<p>The most cost-effective and efficient way to do amazon self-publishing is through ebooks , which allows people to download your work directly to their devices, like the kindle ebook reader. And amazon has facilitated this process with kindle direct publishing program , which has no fees to use &mdash; it&rsquo;s self-publishing with no upfront costs. (you do need an amazon account. ).</p>
<h2>3 Things you can do to double your book sales.</h2>
<p>There are really only two things you can do to cost-effectively promote future book sales: build your fan base; and, market to that fan base. But your fan base isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; investment. Beyond the book launch, your fan base will take nurturing from now until you officially want to stop selling your books. That means investing in social media, podcasts, videos, blogs, events, email subscriber list building, and other public relations efforts to keep you top of mind for fans, both old and new.</p>
<p>Whether you have an official celebration or not, your book launch day is really your first day on the job of being a self published author. Yes, the job. You may write more books over time. But the writing isn&rsquo;t the main focus anymore. You are now in the author and publisher business. You&rsquo;ll be spending your days looking for ways to get your books and content into the hands, hearts, and minds of readers. That means time on social media channels recruiting new fans and engaging with existing ones. You&rsquo;ll be creating fresh non-book content such as videos, podcasts, blogs, and social media posts to share with your fans.</p>
<p>I had a great question come up on one of my youtube videos about selling books at events and expos. The author was wondering how to approach visitors and make more sales. If it&rsquo;s any consolation, this isn&rsquo;t just a question for authors. Lots of business owners and salespeople have the problem, too. Since i worked in the trade show industry for a number of years, and have exhibited at many shows for my business, here are some of the things i&rsquo;ve learned and observed.</p>
<h3>Anyone Selling your book on Amazon.com</h3>
<p>I am blessed to be an amazon #1 bestselling author. But&hellip; - there is something about us authors! we are often reluctant to allow ourselves the luxury of the thought that we can make money from our hard work! plumbers don&rsquo;t have this problem, office workers don&rsquo;t, and construction workers don&rsquo;t. But somewhere along the history of writing it has become accepted that we should spend hundreds of hours creating a wonderful book and then be delighted with a few crumbs in return!.</p>
<p>The kindle is amazon&rsquo;s best-selling product in the site&rsquo;s history. And the megagiant business has had quite a history selling books. Over the past few months, for every 100 hardcovers sold on amazon, consumers bought 180 e-books. James patterson has sold 1. 4 million ebooks &ndash; almost 850,000 of those were kindle versions. The association of american publishers&rsquo; reports that e-book sales grew 163 percent in may 2011 and 207 percent year-to-date through may.</p>
<p>Barely a week goes by where i don&rsquo;t see some &ldquo;i won&rsquo;t work with amazon&rdquo; outburst from a self published author on social media. Here's a recent example. This author was completing an audio book. He didn&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;throw up his hands&rdquo; like other authors and publishers and &ldquo;give&rdquo; his book to audible. So he was looking for advice on hosting and selling it through his website, even though the audio book file was hundreds of megabytes and many hours of listen time in an apple itunes media format.</p>
<p>You can take your existing skills for creating journals and planners for amazon kdp and the printables low content book market and open up a brand new market for yourself. You will earn more money per book than you do on amazon. Why? because you dont have to pay amazon a big chunk of your profit. If you are selling it off your own website, then you have no transaction fees.</p>
<h3>Ebook writers: Can you tell me exactly what you do?</h3>
<p>Nook announced today the launch of nook press, a new self-publishing portal for authors that want to get on the nook store. The service is being built upon the foundation laid by pubit! , barnes &amp; noble&rsquo;s self-publishing business. Authors who are already on pubit! will be able to transition to nook press without any problems. &ldquo;we&rsquo;re thrilled to bring all the new and exciting features of nook press to existing pubit! authors and new writers looking for a quick, effective and free one-stop self-publishing platform that delivers high-quality ebooks to millions of book-loving nook customers,&rdquo; said theresa horner, vice president of digital content at nook media.</p>
<p>Facebook says it wants to &ldquo;empower&rdquo; independent writers and journalists by letting them make money from their work. The social giant on tuesday confirmed plans to launch a new platform for writers to self-publish their content, grow their audience and make money through monetization tools starting with subscriptions. Facebook said the platform will roll out in the coming months in the u. S.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered if you can get fans through writing fiction? you might have tried self-publishing an ebook but got less than stellar results. Or you have gone traditional and met a manifold of rejections. I know, i know. You are going to tell me that even j. K. Rowling got rejected a lot of times. Or that stephen king&rsquo;s carrie also almost went to the garbage bin. I will not fight you with that since that indeed happened. Let&rsquo;s get real. How many aspiring fiction writers succeed?.</p>
<p>I so adamantly believe that knowing how to conduct a ghostwriting interview is a bedrock of success that i wrote a book about it. And even better yet, i&rsquo;m giving that ebook away for free to anyone. While this book doesn&rsquo;t necessarily cover the topic of writers conferences as this blog does, it does serve as a primer for a professional mentality with your writing. I can&rsquo;t think of a better frame of mind to be in during a conference than, i&rsquo;m a professional, i know what i&rsquo;m doing here.</p>
